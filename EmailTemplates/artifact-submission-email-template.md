PoPETs reviews and publishes digital artifacts related to its accepted papers. This process aids in the reproducibility of results and allows others to build on the work described in the paper. Artifact submissions are requested from authors of all accepted papers, and although they are optional, we strongly encourage you to submit your artifacts for review.

Artifacts can include source code for proofs of concept, measurements, simulations, datasets, and build environments. Anything you can think of that would help other researchers and developers of privacy enhancing technologies reproduce, build upon, or deploy your research is encouraged.
